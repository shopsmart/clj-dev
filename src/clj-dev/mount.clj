(ns clj-dev.mount
  "A set of *nix-like utilities making it easier to navigate Clojure
  data structures from a REPL.

  Synopsis:

  (mount data-structure)
  (pwd)
  (current)                 Returns the current object to the REPL or in expressions.
  (current :sub1 :sub2 ...) Return subobject pointed to by :sub1, :sub2, ...
  (ls)                      Display the contents of (current), paged to 20 at a time.
  (ls 2)                    Display the second page of (current), etc.
  (cd :sub1 :sub2 ...)      Change to subobjects via map keys
  (cd 0 3 ...)              Change to subobjects of sequential objects that support (nth)
  (cd :sub1 3 :sub2 ...)    cd forms may be mixed.
  (cd \"..\")               Go up a level in the object hierararchy.
  (cd)                      Return to the top level (root object)"
